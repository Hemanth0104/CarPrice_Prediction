The price of an automobile is determined by a variety of criteria, including the brand's reputation, the car's features, horsepower and mileage, and many more. Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning. 
The prediction of automobile prices is a major field of research in machine learning. It is founded on finance and marketing. It is a key study subject in machine learning since the cost of an automobile is determined by a variety of factors. Some of the major elements that influence automobile prices include:
